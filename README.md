**Khan** is a custom, indentation-based programming language built entirely from scratch in C11 — lexer, parser, bytecode compiler, and VM, with no dependency on any other language's runtime. Created by **Irfan Khan**, this project is a hands-on exploration of compiler design, virtual machine implementation, and standard library engineering, with a 37-package ecosystem spanning web development, classical computer vision, real OCR, and network protocols. The language draws inspiration from Python's clean indentation syntax and Lua's simplicity, while keeping a minimal footprint in pure C.

Honest framing, since this README makes a point of not overstating things: Khan is **pre-1.0** by its own [roadmap](#roadmap)'s criteria. It's a real, working, multi-session-hardened language and runtime, not a toy — but if you're picking a language to ship something in tomorrow, this isn't that. If you want to see how a real bytecode VM and a real package ecosystem get built from nothing, read on.

## Overview

Khan is a from-scratch programming language implementation focused on understanding the fundamentals of how programming languages work under the hood. The project implements a complete language pipeline:

1. **Lexer (Tokenizer)** — Converts raw source code into a stream of tokens
2. **Parser** — Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using recursive descent parsing
3. **Compiler** — Compiles the AST into bytecode (38 opcodes)
4. **Bytecode VM** — A stack-based virtual machine executes the compiled bytecode — this is the real, primary execution engine (an earlier tree-walk interpreter still exists in the source tree, but only for one legacy import-parsing path; it is not what runs your program)
5. **Standard Library** — 30+ built-in functions for I/O, strings, math, arrays, and maps
6. **Native Libraries** — C libraries bridging to real external engines: JSON, datetime, HTTP, SQLite-shaped storage, classical computer vision (with real Haar-cascade face detection), and OCR via Tesseract
7. **Package Manager (`kh`)** — Install community packages with `kh install <name>`

## What's Real, What's a Known Gap

Most from-scratch language projects are tempted to round up. This one tries hard not to — a prior version of the `vision` package shipped a `detect_faces()` that returned two hardcoded boxes regardless of input, and the fix was to rip it out and build real Haar-cascade detection, not to keep it and call it done. That history is worth being upfront about, both the mistake and the fix.

**Real, verified, not mocked:**
- The bytecode compiler + VM — the actual execution path for every script you run
- `vision`'s face detection — real Viola-Jones cascade detection, not hardcoded output
- `ocr` — a genuine native bridge to libtesseract; feeds it real pixel data, not a wrapper around the `tesseract` CLI
- `sqlite` — a real bridge to `libsqlite3` (`sqlite3_prepare_v2`/`sqlite3_bind_*`/`sqlite3_step`), not a JSON-backed mock (an earlier version was; ripped out and rebuilt for real)
- `{}` maps — a real open-addressing hash index (FNV-1a), not a linear scan; the old O(n) version made a 50,000-key map take ~9 seconds, the current one takes ~0.01s (~725x). Full story in [docs/hash-table-audit.md](docs/hash-table-audit.md)
- `try`/`catch`/`throw` — a real exception-handling implementation (unwinds the VM stack and call frames to the nearest handler), not just a parser accepting the syntax. Catches both user `throw`s and every built-in runtime error. Design and a real bug found along the way in [docs/trycatch-implementation.md](docs/trycatch-implementation.md)
- A cycle collector for circular references in arrays/maps (`a[0] = a` no longer leaks for the life of the process) — a Bacon-Rajan trial-deletion collector, the same algorithm CPython's `gc` module uses, not a full tracing GC. Two real bugs found and fixed during testing, plus a >99% leak reduction measured (not just "doesn't crash") in [docs/gc-notes.md](docs/gc-notes.md)
- Testing: thousands of fuzz-mutated parser inputs with zero crashes, memory stress-tested at 10M-allocation scale with flat RSS, CI gating on real assertion suites across Linux/Windows/macOS

**Known, open gaps — not hidden, not fixed yet:**
- String concatenation in a loop is **partially** fixed — a redundant
  length-rescan on the growing accumulator was removed (a real ~2.4x
  win, verified), but the deeper cause is still open:
  `OP_SET_LOCAL`/`OP_SET_GLOBAL`/`OP_SET_UPVALUE` deep-copy the
  assigned value on every write by design, so building a string with
  repeated `+=` in a loop is still worse than linear overall. Full
  story in [benchmarks/RESULTS.md](benchmarks/RESULTS.md)'s
  `string_concat` section.
- Closures are value-capture only — a nested function can read an
  enclosing variable, but there's no shared mutable upvalue, so a
  "counter closure" pattern that mutates captured state doesn't work
  the way it does in Python/JS.

If a claim in this README turns out to not match reality, that's a bug in the README — [open an issue](https://github.com/khandev1211-cpu/Khan/issues).

**On performance, specifically**: Khan is generally slower than Python and Node right now, not faster — roughly 2-8x slower on tight loops, competitive only on JSON round-trips (where it's actually ~2.4x faster than Python). Computed-goto dispatch was tried as the obvious next lever and **measured slower, not faster**, than the existing switch-based dispatch (5-15% depending on benchmark) — reverted; full measurement and why in [docs/dispatch-perf.md](docs/dispatch-perf.md). The next real lead is a `value_copy()` call on every basic operation (even a plain number) — not yet profiled, flagged as the most promising thing to actually measure next. Full numbers and methodology in [benchmarks/RESULTS.md](benchmarks/RESULTS.md).

## Quick Start

**Want to try it before installing anything?** [Try Khan in your browser](https://khandev1211-cpu.github.io/Khan/) — the real compiler and VM, compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten, running client-side with no server involved. (Deployed via GitHub Pages from `playground/` — see [.github/workflows/deploy-playground.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-playground.yml). If that link 404s, GitHub Pages likely isn't enabled yet for this repo — Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions turns it on, then push once or run the workflow manually from the Actions tab.) See [playground/README.md](playground/README.md) for what's and isn't included in that build.

### Install

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khandev1211-cpu/Khan/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khandev1211-cpu/Khan/main/install.ps1 | iex
```
Needs a GCC toolchain on `PATH` already (MSYS2/MinGW-w64) — the script checks for one and tells you exactly what to install if it's missing, rather than silently installing a toolchain for you. **Caveat, stated plainly**: this script was written and reviewed carefully but has not been run on an actual Windows machine in the environment it was authored in (no such access there) — same class of caveat this project's CI workflow already carries for its own Windows steps. If something in it doesn't work as described, that's a bug — please open an issue with what happened.

There's no pre-built binary release yet (see the [roadmap](#roadmap) — v1.0 hasn't shipped), so both installers build from source rather than downloading a binary, the way `rustup`/`deno`'s installers do when there's nothing prebuilt for your platform yet. Neither one runs `sudo`/an elevated prompt on your behalf — they check for what they need and tell you the exact command for your platform if something's missing. Read [install.sh](install.sh) / [install.ps1](install.ps1) before piping either into a shell, same as you should for any curl-pipe installer — that's not Khan-specific advice.

After it finishes — restart your shell on Linux/macOS (or `source` the rc file it mentions); on Windows, `khan` is already on `PATH` in the same PowerShell window, new windows get it automatically too:

```bash
khan --version
khan path/to/script.kh

# Install packages
kh install math
kh install strings
kh install colors
kh install requests
kh install postman
```

```khan
import "math"
import "colors"

print green("Khan is ready!")
print math_sqrt(144)
```

**Prefer to build it yourself, or the installer doesn't fit your setup?**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khandev1211-cpu/Khan.git
cd Khan
make                    # builds khan(.exe) and kh(.exe) in the current directory
make install            # Linux/macOS only — installs both to ~/.khan/bin, same as install.sh's last step.
                        # On Windows, use install.ps1 instead (`make install` prints why and stops).
```

Without `make install`, run the binaries directly as `./khan script.kh` (Linux/macOS) or `khan.exe script.kh` (Windows) from inside the checkout.

## Package Manager — kh

Khan ships with `kh.exe` — a package manager that downloads packages from the official registry hosted on GitHub.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `kh install <name>` | Download and install a package |
| `kh remove <name>` | Remove an installed package |
| `kh list` | Show all available packages in the registry |
| `kh installed` | Show locally installed packages |
| `kh info <name>` | Show details about a package |

### How it works

- Packages are installed to `C:\Users\<you>\.khan\packages\<name>\` on Windows, or `~/.khan/packages/<name>/` on Linux/macOS
- The registry lives at `packages/registry.json` in this repo
- `import "<name>"` in any `.kh` file automatically resolves installed packages

```bash
kh install math
```
```khan
import "math"
print math_sqrt(144)    # 12
print PI                # 3.14159...
```

## Web Framework — webi

`webi` is a Flask-inspired web framework: routing, request/response
helpers, middleware, opt-in security (CSRF, rate limiting, API keys,
CORS), HTML templates (including reading them off disk), static file
serving, and a small HTTP server — all built on top of Khan.

```bash
kh install webi
```

```khan
import "webi"

let app = webi_app()
app = route(app, "GET", "/", fn_index)
app = serve_static(app, "/static", "public")

fn fn_index(req):
    let name = query_get(req, "name", "World")
    return res_html(render("<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>", {"name": name}))

webi_run(app, 8080)
```

Or pull in the security/HTTP-client/JSON helpers in one line with
[`from`-import](docs/from-import.md):

```khan
from webi import webi, security, requests, json
```

**Full reference:** [docs/webi.md](docs/webi.md) — routing, request/response
helpers, middleware, CSRF/rate-limiting/API-key/CORS security,
`render()`/`render_file()`, `serve_static()`, running the server, and
known limitations (single-threaded server, string/NUL-byte caveats for
binary static assets).

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **GCC** (C11) — MinGW64 on Windows, or any POSIX GCC
- **GNU Make**
- **libtesseract** (+ its trained language data) — required by the `ocr` package; the build fails without it rather than silently skipping OCR. See [docs/ocr.md](docs/ocr.md) for the exact install command per platform (apt/Homebrew/MSYS2) — on MSYS2 specifically, note that the language data is a *separate* package from the library itself.
- **libsqlite3** (dev headers) — required by the `sqlite` package's native bridge. `apt install libsqlite3-dev` / `brew install sqlite3` / MSYS2 `mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3`. The build fails without it (missing `sqlite3.h`) rather than silently skipping SQLite support.
- **Windows only**: links `-lwinhttp`, `-lshell32`, and `-lsqlite3` (the first two ship with Windows; sqlite3 does not)
- **Linux/macOS**: links `-lm` and `-lsqlite3`, uses `curl` for HTTP

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khandev1211-cpu/Khan.git
cd Khan
make
```

Produces `khan.exe` (the compiler+VM runtime) and `kh.exe` (package manager) on Windows, or `khan` and `kh` on Linux/macOS.

```bash
make clean   # remove build artifacts
make install # Linux/macOS: install khan and kh to ~/.khan/bin (override with PREFIX=/your/path)
make uninstall # remove them again
```

On Windows, `make install`/`make uninstall` print a pointer to `install.ps1` instead of doing the copy themselves — see that script's own comments for why PATH persistence needs the registry (`[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable`), not something a makefile target can do portably.

The [Quick Start](#quick-start) section's `install.sh` (Linux/macOS) / `install.ps1` (Windows) does the `git clone` + `make` + `make install` sequence above for you, plus PATH setup — this section is the manual, step-by-step equivalent if you'd rather not pipe a script into a shell, or need to customize the build (e.g. `LLM=1` for the optional llama.cpp bridge — see the makefile).

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success |
| `64` | Wrong number of arguments |
| `65` | Parse/syntax error |
| `70` | Runtime error |
| `74` | I/O error (file not found) |

### CLI flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `khan script.kh [args...]` | Run a script; extra args are available inside it as the global array `argv` |
| `khan --version` / `-v` | Print the version and exit |
| `khan --help` / `-h` | Print usage and exit |

## Architecture

### Pipeline

```
Source .kh file
     │
     ▼
  Lexer  ──────────────── Token stream (INDENT/DEDENT/keywords/literals)
     │
     ▼
  Parser ──────────────── Abstract Syntax Tree (31 node types)
     │
     ▼
  Compiler ─────────────── Bytecode (38 opcodes) — see docs/opcodes.md
     │
     ▼
  VM ───────────────────── Stack-based execution — this is what actually runs
     │
     ▼
  Output / Side effects
```

A tree-walk interpreter (`interpreter.c`) exists in the source tree from an earlier design, but it is not the execution path above — it's retained only for one legacy import-parsing case. Every script you run goes through the compiler and VM.

### VM Design

- **Value system**: tagged union (`VAL_NUMBER`, `VAL_STRING`, `VAL_BOOL`, `VAL_NIL`, `VAL_ARRAY`, `VAL_MAP`, `VAL_FUNCTION`, `VAL_NATIVE`)
- **Execution model**: stack-based bytecode VM, 38 opcodes (see [docs/opcodes.md](docs/opcodes.md))
- **Closures**: value-capture only — a nested function can read an enclosing variable, but there's no shared mutable upvalue, so a "counter closure" pattern that mutates captured state doesn't work the way it does in Python/JS. Known limitation, not yet addressed.
- **Memory management**: reference-counted, plus a Bacon-Rajan trial-deletion cycle collector for arrays/maps (runs automatically, also callable as `gc_collect()`) — a circular reference no longer leaks for the process lifetime. Closures aren't covered by the collector yet (separate refcount) — see [docs/gc-notes.md](docs/gc-notes.md) for the full design and known limitation
- **Compiler optimizations**: constant folding is implemented; dead-code elimination, constant propagation, and peephole optimization are not yet

### Package Resolution

`import "name"` resolves in this order:
1. Relative to current script directory (e.g. `./name`)
2. Relative path as-is
3. `~/.khan/packages/name/name.kh` (installed packages)

`from "name" import A, B, C` resolves each requested name against a
plain symbol, the package's own name (flattens the whole module), or a
sibling submodule file next to it (flattens that file's public names) —
see [docs/from-import.md](docs/from-import.md) for details, including
the privacy rule (`_`-prefixed names never get flattened) and the
closure-snapshot ordering constraint that applies to any multi-file
package.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Lexer | ✅ Complete |
| Parser | ✅ Complete |
| Tree-walk interpreter (original design) | ✅ Complete, now legacy — superseded by the compiler + VM below |
| Bytecode compiler + VM | ✅ Complete — the actual execution engine (38 opcodes, see [docs/opcodes.md](docs/opcodes.md)) |
| Standard Library | ✅ Complete |
| Import/Module system, `from X import A, B, C` | ✅ Complete |
| Package manager (`kh`), 37-package registry | ✅ Complete |
| `webi` — routing, security (CSRF/rate-limit/API-key/CORS), templates, static files, `after()` hooks | ✅ Complete |
| `vision` — image I/O, filters, thresholding, morphology, real Haar-cascade face detection | ✅ Complete |
| `ocr` — Tesseract bridge: text, word boxes, orientation correction, searchable PDF, whitelisting, multi-language | ✅ Complete |
| Fuzz testing (parser), memory stress testing (10M-allocation scale), CI across Linux/Windows/macOS | ✅ Complete — CI gates on the full test suite (not just "does it compile"), including a 1000-iteration mutation-fuzzing run |
| `{}` map as a real hash table | ✅ Complete — open-addressing (FNV-1a), see [docs/hash-table-audit.md](docs/hash-table-audit.md) |
| String concatenation performance | 🟡 Partial — redundant rescan fixed (~2.4x), full O(n²) root cause still open, see [benchmarks/RESULTS.md](benchmarks/RESULTS.md) |
| Mutable closures (currently value-capture only) | 🔲 Planned |
| Garbage collector (circular references) | ✅ Complete — cycle collector for arrays/maps, see [docs/gc-notes.md](docs/gc-notes.md) |
| Error handling (`try`/`catch`/`throw`) | ✅ Complete, see [docs/trycatch-implementation.md](docs/trycatch-implementation.md) |
| Dispatch-loop optimization (computed goto) | ✅ Tried, measured slower than the existing switch, reverted — see [docs/dispatch-perf.md](docs/dispatch-perf.md) |
| `webi` threaded server (thread-per-connection, concurrency cap) — see [docs/phase4-plan.md](docs/phase4-plan.md) | 🔲 Planned |
| ONNX Runtime bridge (run pretrained deep-learning OCR models) — see [docs/onnx-ocr-plan.md](docs/onnx-ocr-plan.md) | 🔲 Planned |
| Binary-safe string type (length-prefixed, not NUL-terminated) | 🔲 Planned |
| Self-hosted compiler | 🔲 Planned |
| **v1.0 release** | 🔲 Not yet — see `ROADMAP_STATUS_UPDATED.md` for the full, current criteria-by-criteria status |
