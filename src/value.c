 * Cached string length (SDS-style hidden header)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VAL_STRING stores a bare `const char *` (see interpreter.h) that every
 * read site across the codebase (85 direct `.as.string` reads, checked)
 * treats as an ordinary null-terminated C string — printf("%s"), strcmp,
 * indexing, all of it. Changing that field's type would touch dozens of
 * files for no real gain, since none of those sites need the length.
 *
 * The one place that DOES need the length repeatedly is OP_ADD's string
 * branch in vm.c, which used to call strlen() on the *accumulated*
 * string on every "s = s + x" — O(length) per call, O(N^2) total across
 * a loop of N concatenations (see benchmarks/RESULTS.md's string_concat
 * writeup for the measured 80x blowup at 100k iterations).
 *
 * Fix: every string is allocated with a hidden `size_t` length header
 * placed immediately before the bytes the returned pointer points at
 * (the classic "SDS" trick). `v.as.string` still points straight at the
 * string data — every existing read site keeps working unmodified — but
 * str_length() can now recover the length in O(1) instead of scanning.
 * Construction funnels through exactly two functions (value_string,
 * value_copy) and destruction through exactly one (value_free) — all
 * three are in this file, verified by grepping the whole codebase for
 * any other `.as.string =` assignment or `free(...as.string...)` call
 * (there are none), so this is a fully self-contained change.

 * Cycle collector — VAL_ARRAY / VAL_MAP only
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Arrays and maps (see the ref_count fields above) are the only heap
 * values in Khan that are genuinely SHARED (value_copy increments
 * ref_count rather than deep-copying — see value_copy()) rather than
 * always independently owned. That sharing is exactly what makes a
 * cycle possible: `a = []; a[0] = a` (direct self-reference — note
 * push() specifically does NOT create this, since it builds a brand
 * new array rather than mutating in place; genuine in-place mutation
 * needs index-assignment) or an indirect cycle through two or more
 * objects leaves ref_count that never reaches zero, even once every
 * *external* reference has let go. Plain refcounting can never free
 * that — nothing ever decrements the last ref, because the cycle is
 * decrementing itself. Strings, numbers, bools, nil can't do this
 * (never shared); functions/closures use a separate refcount in
 * `chunk.c`'s `KhanClosure` and CAN in principle cycle too (a closure
 * capturing a variable that indirectly holds the same closure) but
 * that's a much rarer pattern in practice and is a documented
 * follow-up, not covered here.
 *
 * This implements Bacon & Rajan's synchronous trial-deletion cycle
 * collector (the same algorithm CPython's `gc` module uses for its
 * container types) rather than a full stop-the-world tracing GC. The
 * key advantage for this codebase specifically: trial deletion only
 * needs to walk the ARRAY/MAP OBJECT GRAPH itself (each object's own
 * children) — it never needs to know about the VM's stack, call
 * frames, globals table, upvalues, or the try/catch handler stack.
 * Those are the same values a normal `value_free()` already visits
 * via ordinary refcount decrements; nothing extra to enumerate as
 * "roots" in the traditional GC sense, no new integration surface
 * across vm.c/compiler.c/every native library. A full tracing
 * collector would need all of that enumerated correctly (and kept
 * correct as the VM changes) to avoid freeing something still live —
 * trial deletion sidesteps the whole problem by only ever considering
 * objects that a real decrement already touched.
 *
 * The algorithm in one paragraph: every time a decrement leaves an
 * object's ref_count above zero (so it wasn't freed the normal way),
 * that object *might* now be part of an unreachable cycle — it's
 * added to a small "possible roots" buffer instead of being examined
 * immediately (immediate per-decrement checking would be far too
 * expensive to do on every single decrement). `gc_collect_cycles()`
 * processes that whole buffer at once, in three passes: (1) MarkGray
 * — trial-decrement every object reachable from a possible root, as
 * if that root's own references didn't count, so anything still
 * "purely" cyclic ends up with a trial count of zero; (2) Scan — for
 * each object touched, if its trial count is still positive it has a
 * real external reference and everything reachable from it is
 * restored to black/live (undoing the trial decrements); anything
 * left at zero is colored white — a confirmed cycle member with no
 * outside references; (3) CollectWhite — actually free every white
 * object. Objects that survive (colored black) are completely
 * unaffected — their real ref_counts are exactly what they were
 * before collection started, this is what makes "trial" the right
 * word: every trial decrement on a survivor gets undone in Scan.

/* Frees the container structure itself (items array / map entries +

 * algorithm's safety:
 *
 * - If a child is ALSO white (Scan's verdict — see below for why this
 *   check stays trustworthy here), it's part of the SAME garbage
 *   batch: recurse into gc_collect_white() for it, guarded against
 *   revisiting via `buffered` (see next paragraph). No ref_count
 *   decrement — gc_mark_gray() already trial-decremented that exact
 *   edge and Scan already confirmed the result was zero.
 * - Otherwise (child is black — Scan proved it has a real reference
 *   from *outside* this cycle, e.g. a still-live global variable) this
 *   object being destroyed is still giving up one genuine reference to
 *   it, so that edge needs a REAL value_free()/decrement — the child
 *   survives, it just loses this one incoming ref.
 *
 * `buffered` (not `color`) is the reentrancy guard against visiting
 * the same object twice within this free pass — critical for a direct
 * self-reference (`a[0] = a`) or any multi-object cycle, where an
 * object is reachable from more than one edge in the same batch.
 * `color` is deliberately left untouched by this whole function so
 * the white/black check above stays accurate for every remaining edge
 * no matter what order objects are freed in. An earlier version of
 * this function used `color` itself as the reentrancy guard (flipping
 * it to black on entry) — that's what `buffered` is for instead now:
 * reusing `color` collided with the "is this child black-and-live"
 * check above, so a self-referencing array crashed with a stack
 * overflow (value_free recursing into itself indefinitely) the first
 * time this was tested against a real cycle, because the self-edge
 * got misread as "escaped to a live object outside the cycle" and
 * value_free() was called on the very object still being torn down.
 *
 * One more hazard the `buffered` guard alone does NOT cover: it only
 * protects re-entry *through the object graph* (following Value
 * pointers between still-live Objs). It does nothing for the RAW
 * pointer sitting in gc_collect_cycles()'s own `gc_roots` array — if
 * two different roots in the same batch turn out to be reachable from
 * each other (exactly the two-object-cycle case: `a[0]=b; b[0]=a;`),
 * processing the FIRST root can recursively free the SECOND one
 * (since it's just another white node reachable from the first), and
 * gc_roots_cycles()'s driving loop would then call gc_collect_white()
 * on that second root's now-dangling pointer when it reaches that
 * slot — straight into a use-after-free, since by that point the
 * memory doesn't exist to have a color or a buffered flag to check.
 * That's exactly what happened the first time this was tested against
 * a real two-object cycle (single self-reference alone doesn't trigger
 * it — it takes at least two roots in the same buffer where one's
 * subtree reaches the other). The fix mirrors what value_free() already
 * does for the ordinary-free path: gc_unbuffer() below scans gc_roots
 * for a matching pointer and nulls it out — called here too, right
 * before every actual free(), so gc_collect_cycles()'s own array never
 * holds a stale pointer past the point where it's freed, regardless of
 * whether that free happened via the driving loop directly or via a
