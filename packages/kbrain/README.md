## Functions

```khan
linear_regression()                 # Create a new linear regression model
train(model, x, y)                  # Train model using gradient descent → updated model
predict(model, x)                   # Make a prediction for input x
set_params(model, lr, epochs)       # Set learning rate and training epochs
```

#### Example

```khan
# Create model
let model = linear_regression()
model = set_params(model, 0.01, 1000)

# Training data: y = 2x + 1
let x = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
let y = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

# Train
model = train(model, x, y)

# Predict
print predict(model, [6])   # ~13
print predict(model, [7])   # ~15
```
