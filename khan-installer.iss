; Khan — Windows GUI installer (Inno Setup script)
; ============================================================================
; Produces the "download an .exe, double-click, click through a wizard"
; experience Python's own official Windows installer gives — a proper
; setup wizard with an "Add Khan to PATH" checkbox, a Start Menu entry,
; and a normal Add/Remove Programs uninstaller entry. This is a DIFFERENT
; artifact from install.ps1 (which builds from source via a piped
; PowerShell script, closer to how rustup/deno install): this is the
; double-click GUI installer specifically, for people who want that
; experience rather than a terminal command.
;
; HOW TO BUILD THE ACTUAL INSTALLER .exe FROM THIS FILE
; ------------------------------------------------------
; This .iss file is a SOURCE script for Inno Setup, not the installer
; itself. To produce khan-setup.exe:
;   1. Install Inno Setup (free): https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
;   2. Build khan.exe and kh.exe first — this script packages ALREADY-
;      BUILT binaries, it does not compile Khan itself (bundling a full
;      C toolchain just to build two binaries on install would defeat
;      the point of a simple double-click installer). From a Windows
;      machine with the same MSYS2/MinGW-w64 toolchain install.ps1 sets
;      up:
;          make
;      This produces khan.exe and kh.exe in the project root.
;   3. Open this file in Inno Setup (or run it via the command line:
;      "ISCC.exe khan-installer.iss"), with khan.exe/kh.exe/packages/
;      sitting in the SAME directory as this .iss file (adjust the
;      [Files] Source paths below if your layout differs).
;   4. Inno Setup produces khan-setup.exe in an Output\ subfolder —
;      THAT file is what gets distributed/attached to a GitHub Release
;      for people to download and double-click.
;
; NOT VERIFIED END-TO-END: this script was written carefully and
; reviewed against Inno Setup's documented behavior, but has not been
; run through the actual Inno Setup compiler or tested on a real
; Windows machine in the environment this was authored in (no such
; access there) — same class of caveat this project's CI workflow and
; install.ps1 already carry for their own Windows-specific pieces. If
; compiling or running this doesn't work as described, that's a bug —
; please open an issue with what happened.

[Setup]
; A fixed AppId (any valid GUID, generated once and never changed after
; the first real release) lets Inno Setup recognize "this is an
; upgrade of the same app" on future installer versions, rather than
; treating every version as an unrelated program. Generate your own via
; Tools > Generate GUID inside the Inno Setup IDE before a real release
; — this placeholder is fine for testing, but should be replaced once
; and then never touched again.

; Per-user install by default (no admin prompt, installs under the

; computer) choose that instead via a checkbox Inno Setup shows

// per-user Environment registry key directly, the same key Python's
// own "Add to PATH" checkbox and install.ps1's PATH persistence both
// use — see install.ps1's own comment on why that specific key is
// the one that actually persists across new terminal windows, unlike
// $env:PATH-style session-only changes).
